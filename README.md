# K-NN_Mushroom_Classification
This is my tutorial on how one can use Sci-kit learn Python library to classify the mushroom data set on classes: edible VS. poisonous. 

In this tutorial, we do the following:

1. download the dat set from the archive;
2. pre-process it using train-test split technique & select the most relevant features for training;
3. initialize and train our K-NN classifier;
4. make predictions and check its accuracy based on the testing set.

To reduce the data set size I decided to select only a subset of features, which are based on color and odor. 
As a result, we see the accuracy of our prediction is 97%! In other words, our algorithm would correctly identify around 97 out of 100 randomly picked mushrooms.

Even though accuracy is not always the most reliable metric for performance evaluation, this still shows that the color and odor alone are probably ones of the most important feautires when we have to divide mushrooms by their type (edible/poisonous). To learn more about different performance evaluation metrices I recommend this [article](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/9-types-of-performance-evaluation-for-classification-machine-learning-modeling-c6e73e97e528) where I discuss 9 types of performance evaluation for Classification Machine Learning Modeling.
